# Do NOT store real tokens or secrets in the repository.
# This example shows how to provide a GitHub token for local testing.
# Recommended: keep tokens in your browser localStorage or in a real secret store.
# Example localStorage usage (open console in browser):
# localStorage.setItem('github_token', '<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>')

# The app reads the token from localStorage and won't read tokens from files in the repo.
# If you need to set values for development, create a private file outside the repo and
# use a secure method to provide the token to your environment.

# Repository metadata (do not put secrets here):
GITHUB_REPO=cancer
GITHUB_OWNER=medpromx
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
DATA_FILE_PATH=data/patients.csv
